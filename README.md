Pokemon Project

Description:

For this project I used the Pokemon API. I wanted to create an API project that reminded me of pokemon show I watched as kid. For that show it said there was 150 pokemon that existed so what was better for me to list those 150 on a webpage. So that is what I did I made certain calls to get certain information to the screen such as Name, type, image of pokemon, height and weight. 

So you can say this project was a special one for me because it took me back to my childhood memories and was able to successfully create the project how I saw it in my head.
